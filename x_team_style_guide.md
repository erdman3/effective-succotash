# X-Team 56 Style Guide

We all agree Professor Gary Dahl's style guide from our time in CS 300.

## Naming conventions

We agree to use camel case for variable names, and all upper case for constant variables. 
Classes and interfaces have first letter of each word capitalized.

### Examples
* interfaces
* classes
* exception types
* fields
* methods
* parameters
* local variables
* instance constants
* class constants

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:

<brief statement of your team's commenting style>
For single lines '//' is used, For 3 or more lines '/** */' will be used

### Examples

* classes '/** */'
* fields '//'
* constructors '/** */'
* methods '/** */'
* coding style (brackets, horizontal, and vertical spacing) for:
  * if statements
  * switch statement
  * while loops
  * for loops
  * enhanced for loops
  EXAMPLE: if(int i = 0; i < someInteger; i++) {
    
            }
